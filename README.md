# Maple code for Type-III runs

The file `type_III.mw` contains Maple code that implements the formula in Theorem 1 of reference [1] (Equation (9)).  It gives the PMF of the Type III runs of length k, which is more compact than the published
results. This new formula significantly reduces the computational complexity. The code also implements the Markov chain imbedding method for comparison.

For definition of Type-III runs, see reference [2], pp. 155â€“156.
